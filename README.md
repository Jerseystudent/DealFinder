Deal finding bot for discord


Welcome to Dealfinder, a deal finding discord bot for students based in the UK.

How does it works?
User types in $deal followed by the company they want a deal for, it returns the formatted urls for the three largest student discounts sites in the UK 

How can I test it works on my server?
Type in $alright babs. It will return Alright there babs. This is a (not) subtle welsh touch to the code!

What am I working on for this?
1. Currently still returns URLs that takes you to a 404 (not great). Solution: use BeautifulSoup to read the 404 and not return that url to the user
2. Could use more discount sites (current WIP)


Thanks for checking this out and hope you enjoy this (poorly checkstyled) code!
